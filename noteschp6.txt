Chapter 6

Relational algebra, relational calculus

unary - 1 relation
binary - 2 relations aggregate functions - for when relational algebra isn't enough. data summarization

Select - a limiter on data. take some rows, leave some rows.

Project - take some columns, leave some columns.

keeping duplicates results in a multiset.

Union, intersection, set difference - basic set functions. A or B, A and B, A but not B. Only works among tuples of the same type.

Cross products can be done. Combine every tuple of one set with every tuple of another set - not meaningful on its own, but useful depending on context.

Join is very important - concatinate data.

Equijoin - lets us combine by a common value. Natural join - stops the duplication of both identical values.

6 operations form the complete set of relational algebra operations. They are difficult to approximate in text, but roughly look like this:

{o, pi(the symbol), U, p, -, x}


query tree - useful for organizing your searches. Note: There exists, and for all are useful notations.
