CREATE ASSERTION
CHECK()
EXISTS()

Create an assertion, check it, if it's false, the constraint is violated
CHECK(NOT EXISTS()) will violate the constraint if the parameter being checked exists. Can become very confusing if within the NOT EXISTS() there are further NOT statements

CREATE TRIGGER
Triggers an action when the parametersplaced upon a database extend beyond some predetermined bound. If you want to make sure no Employee salary exceeds a supervisor salary, you can throw a trigger to catch it.

BEFORE
INSERT
UDATE
OF

WHEN
NEW

CREATE VIEW
DROP VIEW

WITH CHECK OPTION

DROP
DROP SCHEMA
DROP TABLE
DROP CONSTRAINT

ALTER TABLE

CASCADE This lets you get rid of tables whether or not they are full
RESTRICT this gets rid of tables only if they have been emptied.

Details - Like with all comp sci stuff, you'll need to track the negatives. 
AND
OR
NOT

Whenever the statement x AND NOT y is true, it follows that the statement y OR NOT x is false.

EXISTS is prone to double negatives. NOT EXISTS() means that everything lacking the values in () will be returned. NOT EXISTS() AND NOT EXISTS() returns everything not in EXISTS() OR EXISTS().

JOINS - Always use JOINS when joining tables, unless you really want to cross multiply. 

A view is always up to date, and is a virtual table. dropped with the DROP VIEW command.
