SQL notes

SQL is a structured query language.
Databases using it tend to be very standardized

table - relation
row - tuple
column - attribute

Statements in SQL end with semicolons

Use CREATE TABLE to create tables

datatypes - Numberic (INT, SMALLINT, FLOAT, REAL, etc.)
character string
bit string 
boolean
date

timestamps are important to determine the order of requests

SELECT
FROM
WHERE

Can group a bunch of these with UNION

straightforward search tools, just tell it what you know, what you want, and where to look

There are some useful searches you can do by string, if you don't have all the characters you want or the characters you arte looking for are not in the front of the string.

UPDATE
SET
WHERE

INSERT INTO
VALUES

Remember to end commands with semicolons.
